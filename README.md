# Learning Ruby (with RSpec)

[RSpec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec) describes itself as:

> Behaviour Driven Development for Ruby

And this is great. And RSpec is great.

But, in fact, you're limiting RSpec's usefulness if you use RSpec *only* for
'Behavior Driven Development.'

What if you don't know what Behavior Driven Development is?

What if you don't have any code that you're looking to write tests for?

That's ok. Maybe even good!

## Use RSpec to describe your knowledge

**You can use RSpec to describe what you know about Ruby.**

You don't need to be a Ruby master.

You don't even need to *like* Ruby!

But, if you've found yourself in a situation where you're regularly referring to
[online introductions to Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/)
or always forgetting how you use a
[specific class](http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/forwardable/rdoc/Forwardable.html),
then here's a way forward.

## A Way Forward

What do you get if you learn to use RSpec to describe what you know about Ruby
itself / parts of the standard library / a specific library / whatever?

Once you become familiar with RSpec, it's almost as easy as writing up notes
about the topic at hand.

But, *bonus*, these notes execute themselves on demand.

And, *bonus*, you've got an easier way to reference or share your notes.

## And then?

RSpec itself is a long path. But basic RSpec usage can be a shorter path. Don't
try to make things perfect-- just make them good enough for you right now.

Further, RSpec and Ruby (and programming..) are long paths. This is just one
technique that might be useful as you go.

As you progress, you'll get better with RSpec which will likely come in handy if
you continue working with Ruby.

You learn about a means for taking executable notes. They are easily referenced.
They are easily searched.

But most importantly, you start getting involved with a paradigm that can be
helpfull regardless of the language you're working in. For example-- you can
take the same approach in
[JavaScript](https://github.com/jedcn/learning-javascript).
